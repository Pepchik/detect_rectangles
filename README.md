# Rectangles Detection with OpenCV

This project detects rectangles in an image using OpenCV and highlights them with different colors based on their position in the hierarchy (largest, smallest, others). The program also counts the number of rectangles detected and displays the result.

## Features
- Detects rectangular shapes in an input image.
- Highlights the largest rectangle in red, the smallest in blue, and others in green.
- Counts the number of detected rectangles and prints the result in the terminal.
- Displays the processed image with highlighted rectangles.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
